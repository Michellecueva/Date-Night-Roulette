# Date-Night-Roulette

In today’s world of social media and the vast amount of resources available on the internet, there is just so much out there to do. More specifically there are so many different things a couple can do for a date night, however, these are the common problems that come with couples wanting to go out:

- Couples don’t know what they want to do.
- Bombarded with options that they can't decide
- Want to try something new


Our app will allow users(couples) to build an experience based on their interests. They will each select their interest from a category and our app will find an experience that will include those interests. 


## User Stories: 
**1.** It’s Friday night and Sarah and John are getting ready for their usual date night. They have fallen into the pattern of going to the same old restaurant and ordering the same thing each time. They want to switch it up but don’t know where to start. Sarah tells John about this new app called *Date Night Roulette*. 
They each download the app on their phone and select from a list of categories. Sarah is interested in having some drinks :cocktail: tonight. John wants a place he can dance :notes:. Once they enter their preferences, our app navigates through its database to find an experience that includes dancing and drinks. Sarah likes the event presented and clicks on “Let’s do it!”. John also likes the event and clicks “Let’s do it!”. *Date Night Roulette* then shows that they have a match and directs them to a link for the event.

**2.** Jamie and Kyle know they want to go out tonight but they want to try something new. They download *Date Night Roulette* but don't really have any idea what they are in the mood for. They decide to click on the "Surprise Me!" category to find a random event going on for tonight. Jamie likes the first event presented to them but Kyle is not convinced. He wants to see other options. Kyle shakes the phone and they are now both presented with an event they are both excited for. Date Night Roulette shows them they have a match and presents them with the link for the event.
